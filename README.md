# stack_overflow_question_prediction
A project as part of my Culminating Experience/Thesis work for the Mathematical Data Science major, where I use textual data from StackOverflow questions on the R programming language in order to predict the positivity or negativity rating of such questions through various binary classification methods.

The original dataset of StackOverflow questions is available in the Questions.csv file.
