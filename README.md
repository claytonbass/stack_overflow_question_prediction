# stack_overflow_question_prediction
A project as part of my Culminating Experience/Thesis work for the Mathematical Data Science major, where I use textual data from StackOverflow questions on the R programming language in order to predict the positivity or negativity rating of such questions through various binary classification methods. This project is a modified and extended version of the project I completed as part of Prof. Soroush Vosoughi's COSC 89.21/189.21, a graduate-level course in data mining. 

The original dataset of StackOverflow questions is available in the Questions.csv file.
